# Chapter summary

PAR: Chapter 2 discussion (Mexico)

PAR: Chapter 3 discussion (India)

PAR: Chapter 4 discussion (Uganda)

PAR: Chapter 5 discussion (Italy)


# Methodological discussion

PAR: This section describes the statistical methods deployed in each chapter


## Methodological strengths

PAR: Strengths of SAE

PAR: Directly measures parameters of interest

PAR: Using only data available

PAR: Quantification of uncertainty


## Methodological limitations

PAR: Relies on assumptions
 - Params
 - Spatial
 - Relationships between data sources

PAR: Communicating uncertainty in policy

PAR: Complexity stymies communication

PAR: Privacy concerns




# Interpretations, implications, and future priorities

PAR: 


## Spatial analysis of the epidemiological-surveillance transition

PAR: Overview of sub-section

PAR: Review of epidemiological transition

PAR: Scale and the epi transition - examples from chapters

PAR: Posit a surveillance transition, from surveys to health surveillance

PAR: Again, problematize at the subnational level


## Modeling to enhance the utility of health surveillance data

PAR: Previous literature - models vs. health surveillance

PAR: Review definitions of CRVS quality

PAR: By providing a use case, can actually increase incentives to improve CRVS data



## Future directions

PAR: New surveillance tools for spatial assessment:
 - Spot TB surveys
 - Child mortality?
 - Excess mortality?

PAR: Monitoring and evaluation of CRVS data


# Conclusions

PAR: CRVS and national health data systems are required for long-lasting improvements in global health. Their use cases are inherently spatial.

PAR: Bring it all together
